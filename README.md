# Data Analysis
Following assignments were completed as a part of CS215 (Data Analysis and Interpretation Course)

## Assignment 1
* Plotted probability density function for Laplace PDF, Gumbel PDF, Cauchy PDF.
* Implemented Poisson thinning process.
* Simulated N random walkers in MATLAB, and obtained the Gaussian Distribution plot of their final locations. Using true and empirically calculated mean and variance verified The Law of Large Numbers
* Developed a code to generate random draws from given probability distributions

## Assignment 2
* Plotted given sample points generated from joint probability distribution of 2 random variables as scatter plot and used PCA to best approximate the linear relationship between them and overlaid that line on scatter plot
* Wrote code to generate sample points in the Euclidean Plane distributed in a region according to a given multivariate distribution using random number generator in MATLAB.
* Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to re-represent the given dataset of 28Ã—28 pixel images of handwritten digits using only 84 coordinates and reconstructed the image using those 84 coordinates.

## Assignment 3
* Estimated the mean of sample data points using 
    * Maximum likelihood esimate
    * maximum-a-posteriori estimate with 1) Gaussian prior 2) Gamma prior
* Compared the mean estimated by above methods
